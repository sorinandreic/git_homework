I have learned a lot of things about GIT and GitHub. I also watched the Git and GitHub presentations from the Automation Incubator.

Challenges:
At first sight, it was a bit tricky to do the homework just after I saw the PowerPoint, but after I watched the Automation Incubator presentation about git and GitHub and some Youtube tutorials things started to make sense.

New things learned:

I can say that I learned a lot of things from this hands-on exercises. I worked a little bit with GIT and GitHub on the past projects, but things were not very clear to me.

Feedback:

For me, it would have been helpful if there was someone to present GIT and GitHub features, so that i could ask specific questions in places
